# facebookGroupVisualization

###I'm building a program that will do the following: 

1. Pull data from a public Facebook group that you are apart of, or a Facebook group that you are an admin of.

2. Distill the data down to chunks that the DOM can handle.

3. Display the data in a fashion that gives you insight into how your Facebook group actually operates.

To see an example of step 3, check here: [http://138.68.24.155/](http://138.68.24.155/)
